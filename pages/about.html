      <p>SPACEBLOG is the premier source of space exploration, innovation and astronomy news, chronicling (and celebrating) humanity's ongoing
        expansion across the final frontier. We transport our visitors across the solar system and beyond through accessible, comprehensive 
        coverage of the latest news and discoveries. For us, exploring space is as much about the journey as it is the destination. So from
        skywatching guides and stunning photos of the night sky to rocket launches and breaking news of robotic probes visiting other planets,
        at SPACEBLOG you'll find something amazing every day.</p>
      <h3 class="about-us__subtitle">Our History</h3>
      <p>We are a beginner developers team who are learning front-end.
        This is our first project as a team and our final project as participants at Andersen online course.
        All we have is a little knowledge and a great desire to move on.
        It was not by chance that we have chosen the space theme, because it is immense more than anything else.
        We will never explore it to the end, but we will always strive for doing it. 
        This is very similar to us learning front-end and becoming more professional in this sphere!</p>
